# Assignment-2

Four csv files are stored in an array.

The songs from each file are stored in a separate array then put into an arrayList. All four weeks' worth of songs are now in the arrayList. The arrayList is then removed of duplicate songs that may have appeared in different weeks and sorted in ascending alphabetical order. 

The songs in the arrayList are then inserted into the queue and printed out to an output file called "QueueOutput.txt".

The songs removed from the queue are placed into the stack as the history list. The added songs into the stack are also written out to a file called "StackHistoryOutput.txt".
